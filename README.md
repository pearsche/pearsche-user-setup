# Stereomato's user setup.

This was my user setup. I currently run NixOS (for which you can find my configuration files together with home-manger files [here](https://github.com/pearsche/pearsche-nixos-setup)).

Here you can find my (standalone) home-manager setup alongside some files I didn't manage thru home-manager.
